--Perform One-Hot Encoding on the variable on one or more Categorical Variables in the dataset
--LotShape, LandContour, and LandSlope are categorical variables that do not exhibit a hierarchical or ordinal relationship.
--In this case, applying One-Hot Encoding is a suitable approach for these variables.
